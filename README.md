# Adrafinil

Adrafinil keeps a Mac awake through a closed lid while a coding agent works, then releases the hold when the turn ends. Hooks track active work across agents; a thermal cutout and automatic release of abandoned holds limit unattended runs.

## Counting

Nothing is sent unless you say so. The menu asks once; Settings › General holds the choice. If you count yourself in, Adrafinil sends one anonymous check-in on each day you use it: its own and macOS's versions, the chip family and memory size, the language and the date, how many of the last 7 days you used it, whether this Mac has a lid, and how many kinds of agent it kept awake in the last week. It never includes which agents you run, what you work on, or anything that names you. Turning it off deletes everything this Mac sent.

## Notes

- macOS 26.4+; administrator approval for the privileged helper. [macOS 15 backport](https://github.com/valentine/adrafinil).
- Homebrew: `brew install --cask adrafinil`; install agent hooks in Settings.
- [CLI, custom hooks, and installation quirks](REFERENCE.md).
